# developer-book
This is a personal knowledge base. Keeping such a knowledge base significantly boosts software designer/developer's efficiency as it helps to structure and collect valuable insights being gained while solving problems.  
  
I plan to fill it with at least the following chapters:

* [Java](https://github.com/ivanwolkow/developer-book/blob/main/Java.pdf)
* Spring
* Software and System Design
* Databases
