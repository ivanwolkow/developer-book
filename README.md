This is a personal knowledge base. Keeping such a knowledge base greatly boosts software designer/developer's efficiency as it helps to structure and collect valuable insights being gained while solving problems.  
  
My goal is to fill it with at least the following parts:

* [Java](Java.pdf)
* Spring
* [Software Design](Software%20Design.pdf)
* [System Design](System%20Design.pdf)
* [Containers and Orchestration](Containers%20and%20Orchestration.pdf)
* Databases
* [Amazon Web Services](Amazon%20Web%20Services.pdf)
* [Bash profile tips](zprofile)
* [Build Tools](Build%20Tools.pdf)
