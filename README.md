# developer-book
This is a personal knowledge base. Keeping such a knowledge base greatly boosts software designer/developer's efficiency as it helps to structure and collect valuable insights being gained while solving problems.  
  
My goal is to fill it with at least the following parts:

* [Java](Java.pdf)
* Spring
* [Software and System Design](Software%20And%20System%20Design.pdf)
* Databases
* [Amazon Web Services](Amazon%20Web%20Services.pdf)
* [Bash profile tips](zprofile)
* [Gradle](Gradle.pdf)
